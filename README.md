# RedditProject

Include NumPy, Pandas and NLTK

This was my first project in machine learning. The objective was to predict the topic of a reddit comment, among 10 topics.
A set of labeled reddit comment is available for training the predictor in the file data_train.pkl

first_try.py contains my first attempt. The naive bayes classifiers was based from scratch. The storing was actually pretty bad; it used too much memory.
Tests.ipynb contains a lot of my tests
LogReg.py, NaiveBayes.py, MLP.py, NN.py, RandomForest.py, each contains the best predictor found using the algorithm mentionned in the title.
